# DevStudent Library
This project is a simple social media concept for networking students in development majors. This project is done to learn the MERN stack (it may be updated later using the PERN stack). The project will be hosted on Heroku to showcase the skills demonstrated in this project for perspective employers to see and interact with.

The project focuses on Full-Stack abilities and will be transferable to other tech stacks and unrelated projects.
